Hi! My name is Kamil
=====================================================================================================================================

Scrum Master. Software Test Engineer. Cybersecurity enthusiast.
--------------------------------------------------

I have a strong embedded software testing background. Nowadays I teach about both Agile and Scrum using games and agile coaching so others can progress and have fun at the same time as well. I tried to combine my passion for testing with Agile which helped me progress. For over 5 years I have been playing with web and mobile apps spending some time automating tests. Now I am helping to manage GenAI management chaos.
