Hi! My name is Kamil Senecki
=====================================================================================================================================

Software Test Engineer. Scrum Master. Agile Coach.
--------------------------------------------------

I have a strong embedded software testing background. Nowadays I teach about both Agile and Scrum using games and agile coaching so others can progress and have fun at the same time as well. I tried to combine my passion for testing with Agile which helped me progress. For over 3 years I have been playing with web and mobile apps spending last year automating tests.
